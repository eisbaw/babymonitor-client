# Stream playback — `babymonitor-cli stream` (TASK-0070)

Operational doc for the `stream` subcommand: it consumes the decoded media from the
PATH-A engine (`re/media_decode_spec.md`) and re-muxes the H.264 into **MPEG-TS over
HTTP** so a standard player connects. This is the "view the baby" output stage.

## Play it (live or replay, `--output http` default)

The Rust side feeds **decrypted Annex-B H.264** to `ffmpeg`, which muxes MPEG-TS and
serves it at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/stream.ts` (default port 8554). Connect with:

```sh
vlc    http://127.0.0.1:8554/stream.ts
mpv    http://127.0.0.1:8554/stream.ts
ffplay http://127.0.0.1:8554/stream.ts
```

`ffmpeg -listen 1` serves a single client; start the player after the subcommand
prints `serving MPEG-TS at …`.

## Pipeline (what `stream` wires)

```
login → device discovery → MQTT 302 signaling → MediaEngine (suite-3 AES-128-CBC +
20B HMAC-SHA1 / KCP / fixed-12B RTP) → conv demux:
  conv 1 video → H264Depacketizer (STAP-A/FU-A → Annex-B) → AccessUnitAssembler
  conv 2 audio → raw 16 kHz mono S16LE PCM (downstream, NOT G.711)
→ ffmpeg → MPEG-TS (h264 + AAC) over HTTP
```

The assembled live driver is `babymonitor-cli/src/stream_live.rs` (gated under
`--features live`; see `re/live_stream_run.md` for the owner run steps).

### Audio — two directions, do NOT conflate

| direction | conv | format | module | confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **downstream** camera→app (listen to baby) | 2 | raw **S16LE @ 16 kHz mono** | `media::audio` | **[C]** cap4 byte-exact |
| **talk-back** app→camera (speak to baby) | — | G.711 µ-law (PCMU, PT 0, 8 kHz) | `media::g711` | [I] |

The earlier doc claimed the audio channel was G.711 µ-law @ 8 kHz — that is the
**talk-back** direction only. The **downstream** camera audio is raw 16 kHz mono
S16LE PCM, carried verbatim as the RTP payload after the fixed-12B header
(`emulator_captures/cap4/stage6_extract.py` `extract_audio`; `media::audio`). It is
muxed into the TS as an AAC track (`stream --replay-audio …` offline; the live pump
routes conv 2 to the audio FIFO). The crypto/auth is **HMAC-SHA1 (20-byte
trailer)**, not the spec's earlier SHA-256 guess — corrected by cap4
(`FUN_0016a004:100 mbedtls_md_info_from_type(5)=SHA1`; `media/crypto.rs`).

## Honest status

- **Live path** (no `--replay-annexb`): wired but **gated** — there is no
  authenticated device session and no live Tuya broker/camera in the static-analysis
  sandbox, so it stops at the first honest gate and returns `StreamPending` (never a
  fabricated stream). The owner runs it for real after injecting a captured session
  (README §6).
- **Replay path** (`--replay-annexb <file.264>` [`--replay-audio <file.s16le>`]):
  fully runnable **offline** — it exercises the real `rtp::parse_rtp` +
  `H264Depacketizer` + `AccessUnitAssembler` on a synthetic/captured Annex-B sample
  and re-muxes (with the optional downstream-audio track) through the ffmpeg sink.
- **`emulator_captures/cap4` now EXISTS and byte-validates the engine.**
  `tests/cap4_replay.rs` (`#[ignore]`d, local-only) replays the real cap4 capture
  through the committed `MediaEngine` and reconstructs **byte-identical** output to
  the independent ground truth: **4 090 176 B** H.264 video (conv 1) and
  **1 532 800 B** S16LE audio (conv 2). The `cap4_unified_pump_routes_av_to_truth`
  test proves the same conv-based A/V routing the live pump uses. Decode is no longer
  synthetic-only.

## Offline validation (no camera) — `just stream-validate`

Synthesizes a baseline Annex-B H.264 sample **and a 16 kHz mono S16LE audio
sample**, replays them through the depacketizer + A/V muxer, and asserts with
`ffprobe` that the produced MPEG-TS carries a decodable `h264` video AND an audio
track:

```sh
# what `just stream-validate` does, by hand:
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc=size=320x240:rate=15:duration=1 \
    -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -pix_fmt yuv420p -g 15 -bf 0 -f h264 sample.264
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "sine=frequency=440:duration=1:sample_rate=16000" -ac 1 -f s16le audio.s16le
# video-only:
babymonitor-cli stream --replay-annexb sample.264 --output ts --ts-out out.ts
ffprobe -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=codec_name -of csv=p=0 out.ts   # -> h264
# A/V (downstream audio muxed alongside video):
babymonitor-cli stream --replay-annexb sample.264 --replay-audio audio.s16le --output ts --ts-out av.ts
ffprobe -show_entries stream=codec_type -of csv=p=0 av.ts                          # -> video + audio
```

`just stream-validate` is part of `just e2e`. The byte-exact decode proof is the
local-only cap4 replay (above): `cargo test -p babymonitor-core --test cap4_replay
-- --ignored`.

## Output modes

| `--output` | Result | Player |
|---|---|---|
| `http` (default) | MPEG-TS over HTTP at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/stream.ts` | `vlc`/`mpv`/`ffplay <url>` |
| `ts` (`--ts-out F`) | MPEG-TS written to file `F` | offline `ffprobe`/playback |
| `stdout` | raw Annex-B H.264 to stdout (video only — no audio mux) | `… --output stdout \| mpv -` (or `ffplay -f h264 -`) |

`--replay-audio <file.s16le>` (with `http`/`ts`) muxes the downstream 16 kHz mono
S16LE audio as an AAC track alongside the video. ffmpeg is the downstream
muxer/server (a pure-Rust MPEG-TS muxer is a possible future follow-up); the Rust
side feeds it the decrypted Annex-B video on `pipe:0` and the S16LE audio on a
second input (a file for replay; a FIFO for the live pump). Raw Annex-B has no
timing, so ffmpeg is given `-r 15` + `-bsf:v setts=ts=N` to stamp monotonic PTS.
